== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to rename a single media? =

Go to the Media section of the admin panel and open a media of your choice. You will see a new field named "Filename" and your current filename in it. Change it to whatever you want the new name to be and hit the "Update" button.

= How to bulk rename medias? =

Go to the Media section of the admin panel, select the "Rename" or "Rename & Retitle" bulk action (depending on if you want the media get retitled too) from the dropdown, check the medias you would like to rename and change their filenames using the "Filename" fields at the last column. When you are done, hit the "Apply" button and let the plugin do its magic!

= Can I use the plugin to rename medias via code? =

Sure, you can use the "do_rename" static function, located at the Phoenix_Media_Rename class. Prototype: Phoenix_Media_Rename::do_rename($attachment_id, $new_filename, $retitle = 0). On success the function returns 1, and on error - the error message.
